# Thinning Veil Planning

### What makes this game unique?

1. Flash events

This game is built on a purgatory theme that explores the idea of a mortal and spiritual world that are intimately connected. Flash events are those that flash on screen during a turn to expose the spiritual realm briefly. These events are meant to capture the player's attention, but not entirely reveal enough information for them to gather what they just saw. These events should happen in a player's periphery to confuse/intrigue them.

2. Minimalism

This game relies on whitespace to emphasize restricted field of vision. Your vision will slowly grow to encompass more of the screen as you progress. This is because you've gained more spiritual "sight."

3. A huge spread of modifiers and items (potentially procedurally generated?)

A goal of this game is to create a massive list of modifiers and items list so that a player is always using different items that have ever-changing properties. There will be set categories for these things so a player can have some level familiarity with an item's play style, but the goal is to tweak these each game so that it is always fresh and interesting.

4. The feeling of instability

The gameplay should never routine-based, static, or boring. The player should get the feeling that they can't entirely trust everything around them, and should get the feeling that the world of the game is shifting like the wind. This shouldn't be a disruptive process, but more like a gentle reminder.

### Lore

This game draws heavily from Jewish folklore, and also from Christian tradition. The King of Goodness is called Eloah, which is a Hebrew word for deity, and the King of Evil is called Abbadon, which is also Hebrew meaning "destroyer," but is understood to refer to the devil. Unlike Jewish tradition, game completion can be do be following either king, but both come with their own challenges. Eloah is a just king, but that can sometimes hurt you if you disrespect him or those of his host. He is also very powerful, giving strong abilities to those who follow him. Abbadon is a big giver, but an even bigger taker. He will tempt the player at nearly every turn, necessitating diligence to avoid items under his curse. Playing as his follower is beneficial at first but the payback will tax the player. Abbadon will spite without reason, and demand of the player when they are less than able to give.

### Creatures

- Animals
The game contains a fairly diverse group of animals that may align to either king.

- Spiritual beings
Each alignment has its own group of inter-planar beings that can transfer via rips in the fabric between the purgatory and spiritual planes. These beings have all manner of different properties, but their activity depends on the player's personal alignment.

- Golems
In accordance with Jewish lore, a golem can be created out of clay to serve a master until they are made obsolete. A golem can exhibit similar qualities to the physical form they are made in, but carry the spiritual alignment of their creator. A golem can only attack physically and carries power porportional to its weight and size.

- Animated items
Almost all weapons and some items can become animated. The animation of the object will follow some alignment, and will sometimes become inanimate upon defeat. These items are not under the affect of a Poltergeist, but a single spirit.

- Vindinctive spirits
Items will sometimes belong to a vindictive spirit that will attack you upon equipping an item. These aren't normally very dangerous, just irritating.

- Entangled spirit
Occasionally, an equippable item will be entangled with a spirit that will enchant the weapon with certain abilities. These spirits maybe be freed through ritual which may improve a player's alignment in either direction.

### Attribute Ideas
Attributes may be good, nuetral, or bad. They may be physical, spiritual, or conditional attributes (may impart conditions on the victim or the user).
